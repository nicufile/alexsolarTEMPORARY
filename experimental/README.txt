This folder is for jointly edited files.

For now, let's not use this directory until we become familiar with the system.

Files in this directory can be edited by either Doug or Alex.  
Of course, if both edit the same file at the same time, there may need to be a manual "merge", 
where someone has to manually pick what to keep - this can be a lot of work.  Of course, if 
stuff is left out that is wanted again later, it is possible to look at old versions.
